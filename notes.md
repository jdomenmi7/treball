## Introduction
#### @see: pcgbook.com
The definition we will use is that PCG is the algorithmic creation of game content with
limited or indirect user input.
<br><br>
In particular, <b>a key requirement of generated content is that it must be playable—it should be possible
to finish a generated level</b>, ascend a generated staircase, use a generated weapon or
win a generated game.<br>
The terms “procedural” and “generation” imply that we are dealing with computer
procedures, or algorithms, that create something.<br>
A PCG system refers to a system that incorporates a PCG method as one of its parts, for example
an adaptive game or an AI-assisted game design tool.<br>
