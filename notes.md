## Introduction
#### @see: pcgbook.com
The definition we will use is that PCG is the algorithmic creation of game content with
limited or indirect user input.
<br><br>
In particular, <b>a key requirement of generated content is that it must be playable—it should be possible
to finish a generated level</b>, ascend a generated staircase, use a generated weapon or
win a generated game.<br>
The terms “procedural” and “generation” imply that we are dealing with computer
procedures, or algorithms, that create something.<br>
A PCG system refers to a system that incorporates a PCG method as one of its parts, for example
an adaptive game or an AI-assisted game design tool.<br>
Generic content generation refers to the paradigm of PCG where content is generated
without taking player behaviour into account, as opposed to adaptive, personalised
or player-centred content generation where player interaction with the game 
is analysed and content is created based on a player’s previous behaviour. Most
commercial games tackle PCG in a generic way, while adaptive PCG has been receiving
increasing attention in academia recently. A recent extensive review of PCG
for player-adaptive games can be found in. <br>
Deterministic PCG allows the regeneration of the same content given the same starting
point and method parameters as opposed to stochastic PCG where recreating the
same content is usually not possible. <br>
In constructive PCG, the content is generated in one pass, as commonly done in
roguelike games. Generate-and-test PCG techniques, on the other hand, alternate
generating and testing in a loop, repeating until a satisfactory solution is generated <br><br>
Until recently, PCG has allowed limited input from game designers, who usually
tweak the algorithm parameters to control and guide content generation while the
main purpose of PCG remains the generation of infinite variations of playable content. <br>
However, a new interesting paradigm, has emerged that focuses
on incorporating designer and/or player input through the design process. In this
mixed-initiative paradigm, a human designer or player cooperates with the algorithm
to generate the desired content.<br><br>
 Some PCG systems are tools: instruments that
give designers enhanced capabilities, in the way that a programmer’s development
environment or an architect’s CAD system do. Others define new kinds of materials,
allowing a designer to work in a new medium, the way stone, clay, and laser installations
are different materials for an artist. Some PCG systems are intended to be
designers themselves, carrying out fully autonomous design of parts or even entire
games, rather than assisting game designers. Finally, some systems are primarily
domain experts, carrying with them extensive knowledge of game design that can
be used to critique or improve designs. Many systems can be viewed through more
than one of these lenses, though few will exhibit all of them equally.<br><br>
